# JSONLahman
This is a tool that translates the Lahman database into JSON
It comes with a Derby SQL database of the Lahman tables:

PitchingPost

Appearances

Teams


If you have Java installed and use Windows:

1. Open command prompt (Windows+R "cmd"+Enter)

2. navigate to JSONLahman/bin

3. java -jar Mapper.jar

That will generate the .json files into JSONLahman/out
