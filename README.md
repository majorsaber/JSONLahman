# JSONLahman
This is a tool that translates the Lahman database into JSON
It comes with a Derby SQL database of the Lahman tables:

If you have Java installed and use Windows:
1. Open command prompt (Windows+R "cmd"+Enter)
2. navigate to the /bin folder of the JSONLahman folder
3. java -jar Mapper.jar

That will generate the .json files in the /out folder inside the JSONLahman folder
